GeneticAlgorithm
================

This code was written jointly by Matther Odinga and Robin Taylor.

A simple Genetic Algorithm to utilise mutation and roulette wheel survival to model evolution over a 5 chromosome gene.

 This is a Genetic algorithm which will generate 5 chromosomes which for use in a 5th order equation
  these chromosomes will be subject to fitness comparisons against randomly generated chromosomes
  with a survival of the fittest ensuring positive evolution of the gene.
  
  There are several 'Print to check' tests within the code which print values to the screen for 
  visual inspection, as the code was developed on a tight time frame, they remained until the last and
  were not cleaned out.


This was produced to a evolve a 5th order equation to a predetermined equation, it will run for a set number o
iterations and produce an accuracy, a good result would result in an accuracy of order 10^-12. While this may
not seem a great deal, over the entropy values possible for a 5th order equation this is acceptable for a small
scale algorithm on a small scale machine.


Due to a severe data loss, this is the most up to date copy of the code maintained, it may not be fully functional
or produce the intended results, it should only be used as a guide for similar endeavours.
